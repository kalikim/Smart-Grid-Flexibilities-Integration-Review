# Smart-Grid-Flexibilities-Integration-Review

This repository contains the LaTeX source (`.tex`) and PDF (`.pdf`) files of the research paper titled "Flexibilities Review: Integration into Smart Grids".

## Abstract

In the recent past, there has been a huge pressure on the power system due to increased demand for energy consumption. Power systems have faced supply and demand pressure, as well as the challenge of ensuring clean and reliable energy supply. The need for flexibility in the system has become crucial with the introduction of renewable energies. Integrating renewable energy into existing architecture was challenging, but the advent of smart grids has created endless opportunities for optimization of power systems. This paper focuses on virtual power plants (VPP), starting with a brief overview of smart grids, components of smart grids, analysis of how VPP works, integration of VPP into Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) architecture, and current VPP projects.
